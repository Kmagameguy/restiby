# Restic Backup

WIP, name pending.  This repository contains ruby-based helper utilities to make working with [restic backups][restic-backups] and restores easier.

Inspiration comes from [autorestic][autorestic], which, at time of writing (July 2025) looks like it may be a dormant project?  I also prefer ruby over golang.
Also, this blog post, [Backup with Restic][backup-with-restic] by [Thomas Queste][tomquest], who also maintains a pretty fabulous docker-radicale project.
